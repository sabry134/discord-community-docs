# DDoS Protection Policy

## Overview

This comprehensive document articulates the meticulously designed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection policy entrenched within the server's codebase. The paramount objective is to fortify the server's resilience, assuring its continual availability and stability even in the face of potential DDoS onslaughts. The multifaceted defense strategy encompasses the fortification of routes as private and the ubiquitous application of DDoS protection measures across the entire server infrastructure.

## Private Routes

In fortifying the server against potential security breaches, all routes have undergone meticulous configuration to be designated as private. This strategic measure effectively curtails access to only authorized entities, thereby acting as a bulwark against unauthorized intrusions and mitigating potential security vulnerabilities.

## DDoS Protection

### Rate Limiting

One of the linchpins of the DDoS protection strategy is the implementation of rate limiting through the integration of the `express-rate-limit` middleware. This tactical approach serves as a formidable deterrent, thwarting abuse by imposing constraints on the frequency of requests originating from a single IP address within predetermined time intervals. This fortification significantly reduces the risk of overwhelming the server with an influx of requests during a potential DDoS attack.

### CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

A pivotal layer of defense is erected through the meticulous configuration of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). By judiciously delineating and allowing requests solely from pre-approved origins, the server fortifies itself against unauthorized cross-origin requests. This strategic control over domain access acts as a robust security mechanism, ensuring that requests originate only from trusted and authenticated sources.

### Maintenance Mode

Incorporated within the server's arsenal is a dynamic Maintenance Mode toggle. Activating this mode facilitates a controlled environment, allowing selective restriction or temporary unavailability of certain functionalities. This feature serves as a preemptive shield during maintenance activities, fostering a secure environment and thwarting potential security threats that might exploit vulnerabilities during these periods.

## Conclusion

The amalgamation of private routes, judicious rate limiting, meticulous CORS configuration, and the dynamic Maintenance Mode toggle forms a formidable defense architecture against the deleterious impacts of DDoS attacks. The server's commitment to vigilance includes regular monitoring and adaptive updates to these security measures, ensuring an ever-responsive and secure operational environment resilient to evolving security threats.
