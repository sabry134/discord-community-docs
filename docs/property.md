# Project Repository Management Policy

## GitHub Organization and Repository Ownership

Our projects are hosted within the GitHub organization dedicated to handling website requests. The following comprehensive guidelines outline the ownership and management of repositories:

### 1. Repository Access and Ownership

1.1. **Automatic Invitation:**
   - Users requesting projects are automatically invited to access the repository associated with their project.
   - Access permissions are managed according to the project's requirements.

1.2. **Organization's Ownership:**
   - The repository ultimately belongs to the organization, and the organization retains full ownership rights.
   - The organization reserves the right to delete, archive, or edit the repository to maintain quality and compliance.

### 2. User's Rights and Responsibilities

2.1. **Editing Local Copies:**
   - Users are free to clone the repository and make edits on their local environment.
   - The responsibility for any edits or modifications made by the user lies solely with the user.

2.2. **Limited Permissions:**
   - While users have access to the repository, certain actions like repository deletion or major structural changes are reserved for organization administrators.

2.3. **Liability Disclaimer:**
   - The company is not liable for any damage caused by the user's own edits, whether intentional or unintentional.
   - Users are encouraged to thoroughly test their modifications before deploying changes to production environments.

### 3. Organization's Control and Responsibilities

3.1. **Repository Management:**
   - The organization is responsible for ensuring the overall health and security of the repository.
   - Routine maintenance, including updates, security scans, and code quality assessments, may be performed by the organization.

3.2. **Compliance and Standards:**
   - The organization ensures that repositories comply with industry standards, licensing agreements, and legal requirements.

3.3. **Archiving and Deletion:**
   - The organization reserves the right to archive or delete repositories that are inactive, obsolete, or no longer aligned with the organization's goals.

### 4. CI/CD Integration for Security

4.1. **Automated CI/CD Processes:**
   - A Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is integrated into all repositories for security purposes.
   - Automated processes include code builds, unit testing, security scans, and deployment steps.

4.2. **Non-Negotiable Integration:**
   - CI/CD integration is non-negotiable and is applied to all repositories, regardless of customer agreement, to ensure the security and stability of the projects.

### 5. User's Freedom to Clone and Edit

5.1. **Local Copy Recommendations:**
   - Users are encouraged to maintain a local copy of the repository for individual edits or enhancements.
   - This practice ensures that users have a backup of their work and can track changes effectively.

5.2. **Version Control Best Practices:**
   - Users are recommended to follow version control best practices when making changes, such as creating branches for features or bug fixes.

## Conclusion

This comprehensive policy emphasizes transparency, delineates the rights and responsibilities of both the organization and users, and underscores the importance of collaboration while respecting ownership boundaries. It ensures that the organization retains control over repositories, allowing users the flexibility to clone and edit their projects locally responsibly, with added security through CI/CD integration.
