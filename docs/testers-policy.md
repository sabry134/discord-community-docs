4. **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Confirm that the dashboard functions consistently across different web browsers.
5. **User Experience:** Assess the overall user experience, ensuring it is intuitive, user-friendly, and meets design expectations.

## Testing Types

### 1. **Unit Testing**

- **Objective:** Validate individual components and functions.
- **Responsibility:** Developers should perform unit tests for their code changes.
- **Tools:** Utilize testing frameworks relevant to the technology stack.

### 2. **Integration Testing**

- **Objective:** Verify interactions between integrated components.
- **Responsibility:** Developers and QA team.
- **Tools:** Use testing frameworks and tools that support integration testing.

### 3. **System Testing**

- **Objective:** Evaluate the complete system's compliance with specified requirements.
- **Responsibility:** QA team.
- **Tools:** Testing frameworks, automation tools, and manual testing.

### 4. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**

- **Responsibility:** QA team and end-users.
- **Tools:** Manual testing with real users simulating real-world scenarios.

## Bug Reporting

If you discover any issues during testing, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Detailed Report:** Clearly document the steps to reproduce the issue, expected behavior, and actual behavior.
2. **Include Screenshots or Videos:** Provide visual aids to help developers understand the problem.
3. **Specify Browser and Environment:** Clearly mention the browser, operating system, and any specific environment details.
4. **Use the Bug Tracking System:** Log bugs using our designated bug tracking system.

## Communication
