## Introduction

The Emulator is designed to assist developers and designers in visualizing their web content. It provides a simulated environment where you can preview the appearance of your HTML, CSS, and other web elements.

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Emulator

To access the emulator, follow these steps:

1. [Install Dependencies](#install-dependencies): Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed.
2. [Run the Emulator](#run-the-emulator): Start the emulator to launch the simulation environment.
3. [Authenticate](#user-authentication): Log in to the emulator using your credentials.

### User Authentication

User authentication is necessary to personalize the emulator environment. Users can log in using their credentials, and the emulator will customize the experience based on the user's information.

## Emulator Configuration

The emulator provides a YAML-based configuration system to customize the appearance. Use the following YAML structure as an example:

```yaml
emulator:
  backgroundColor: "#333"
  header: "green"
  headColor: "grey"
  centerColor: "red"
  footerColor: "yellow"
```

## YAML Configuration

- **backgroundColor:** Sets the background color of the emulator.
- **header:** Defines the color of the header.
- **headColor:** Specifies the color for the head section.
- **centerColor:** Sets the color for the central content area.
- **footerColor:** Defines the color of the footer.


More features will be added to enhance configurability.


## Embedding Content

Users can embed yaml code into the emulator to visualize how it will appear. The emulator dynamically applies the provided styles and displays the embedded content.
