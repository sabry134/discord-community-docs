# Project Follow-Up System Documentation

## Overview

The Project Follow-Up System is designed to allow users to track and follow up on their own project IDs efficiently. It provides a seamless experience for monitoring project updates, receiving notifications, and visualizing project progress.

## Key Features

1. **Project ID Ownership:**
   - Users can only follow up on project IDs associated with their accounts. This ensures data privacy and restricts access to project information.

2. **Real-time Notifications:**
   - Users receive real-time notifications when there are updates to their projects. Notifications include information such as project status changes, new comments, or other relevant changes.

3. **Discord Webhook Integration:**
   - Users have the option to integrate Discord webhooks for receiving project updates directly in their Discord channels. This enhances communication and collaboration within teams.

4. **Dashboard Notifications:**
   - In addition to Discord notifications, users can view project updates directly within the application's dashboard. This provides a centralized location for monitoring all project-related activities.

5. **Progress Bar Visualization:**
   - A progress bar is incorporated into the system to visually represent the current status of the followed project. This feature provides a quick and intuitive way for users to assess project progress at a glance.

## Workflow

### 1. Project Follow-Up

- Users log in to the system, and upon authentication, they gain access to their personalized dashboard.

- Users can only follow up on project IDs associated with their accounts. They input the project ID they want to follow up on in the search bar.

### 2. Real-time Notifications

- When a project undergoes changes or updates, users are immediately notified through:
  - Discord Webhook: If configured, a notification is sent to the linked Discord channel.
  - Dashboard Notification: Updates are displayed within the dashboard in a dedicated section.

### 3. Discord Webhook Integration

- Users have the option to set up a Discord webhook for each project they follow. This allows them to receive updates in real-time in their chosen Discord channels.

- Webhooks provide a seamless integration between the Follow-Up System and Discord, fostering efficient cross-platform communication.

### 4. Progress Bar Visualization

- The progress bar visually represents the completion status of the followed project. It is updated in real-time as the project progresses or undergoes changes.

- The progress bar is color-coded or segmented, providing a clear indication of project status, milestones achieved, or outstanding tasks.

## Use Cases

1. **Project Tracking:**
   - Users can easily track the status and progress of their projects without navigating through extensive menus.

2. **Collaboration:**
   - Discord webhook integration facilitates team collaboration by keeping all team members informed about project updates.

3. **Efficient Communication:**
   - Users can receive timely notifications, reducing the need for manual checks and enhancing communication efficiency.

4. **Visual Project Assessment:**
   - The progress bar enables users to visually assess project status, allowing for quick decision-making and prioritization of tasks.

## Conclusion

The Project Follow-Up System streamlines the process of monitoring and managing projects by providing a user-centric approach with real-time notifications, Discord integration, and a progress bar for intuitive project assessment. This system enhances collaboration and ensures that users are always informed about the latest developments in their projects.
